# HomePage_Captain

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaTrainao/HomePage_Captain/master/scrot.png )

My minimal homepage. Made for Firefox and has that good old Star Trek vibe.

There is no install, just download and open 'welcome.html'. 
If you're using a screen larger then the image I suggest that you remove the background or the change the background of the text box.

I probably be working on this more.
